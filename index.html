                <p>Being stronger in the basic barbell lifts makes everything else you do in the gym easier. It
                    makes it
                    easier to get bigger,
                    build endurance, and perform conditioning work. It's even easier to cut up when you're stronger
                    as
                    you can handle a higher
                    load and perform more work in the gym.
