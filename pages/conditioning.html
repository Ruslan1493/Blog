    <h2>What Is a Body Conditioning Exercise?</h2>
    <p>You might hear trainers and fitness gurus tossing around the word "conditioning" -- it
        can refer to several different types of exercise. Body conditioning refers to exercises that increase your
        strength,
        speed, endurance or any other physical attribute. Conditioning workouts can trim fat, increase muscle tone
        and prepare your body for the rigors of sports. Virtually every exercise you do at home or in the gym is a
        form of body conditioning, but you should design balanced workouts to get the most out of your routine.

            1. Aerobic Conditioning
            <p>When you go for a morning swim, take to the track in the afternoon sun or do your 30-minute routine on
                the elliptical, you're putting your body through aerobic conditioning. The main purpose of aerobic
                conditioning is to use large muscles for extended periods of time, increasing your cardiovascular
                endurance in the process. Aerobic exercise can trim weight, increase stamina, strengthen your heart
                and keep your arteries clear.</p>

            2. Anaerobic Conditioning
            <p>Anaerobic exercise, which is sometimes called metabolic conditioning, involves short, intense workouts
                that use fast-twitch muscles such as burpees, jump rope, jumping jacks and squat thrusts. According
                to a 2012 study conducted by Canadian researchers at Queen's University, four minutes of interval
                training increases your cardio endurance as much as 30 minutes on a treadmill, and it has the added
                benefit of increasing muscular endurance.</p>

            3. Building Muscle and Strength
            <p>In addition to aerobic and metabolic conditioning, you can also condition your muscles for strength
                by doing weighted or body-weight resistance exercises. Lifting weights or performing pushups,
                crunches and other body weight exercises results in minor trauma to your muscles, which causes
                them to rebuild stronger than they were before. Strength training is a form of anaerobic conditioning,
                but typical strength workouts don't involve fast, intense intervals like those done in
                metabolic training.</p>

            4. Considerations
            <p>No matter what type of conditioning you're getting into, evaluate your personal fitness goals,
                your current conditioning level and any physical limitations or injuries that could hinder you
                during these routines. One approach to training is to vary the type of conditioning you do
                day by day, alternating between aerobic and anaerobic workouts to round out your routine
                and get the best of both worlds.</p>
