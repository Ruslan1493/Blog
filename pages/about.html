        <p>It's always easier to tear others down than it is to build yourself up.
            It's easier to demand respect than to earn it. Of course, the easy way isn't always the best way...</p>

    <div class="about-content">
        <p>I see how downhill sprinting overloads the movement pattern (neuromuscular process)and
            forces more rapid contractions BUT these faster movements are counteracted by ingraining an
            improper and in efficient over striding movement pattern and thus will not carry over properly.

            Hence the recommendation for shallow slopes plus such training should be done concurrently
            with flat land sprinting to allow for a better transfer to regular sprinting. Also steep
            inclines-
            like the stairs recommendation are very dangerous due to the high impacts. Even downhill
            sprinting on low degree slopes should only be embarked upon in a well trained individual.
            Otherwise the joints may not be prepared for the increased impact. This is an advanced training method.

            Considering most sprinters not at the elite level are not even capable of fully extending
            their hips at toe off, one would see better improvements starting with the basics, proper hip extension strength and power.
