    <h2>Gain Strength</h2>
    <!--<div class="line-left">-->
    <p>Being stronger in the basic barbell lifts makes everything else you do in the gym easier. It
        makes it
        easier to get bigger,
        build endurance, and perform conditioning work. It's even easier to cut up when you're stronger
        as
        you can handle a higher
        load and perform more work in the gym.
    </p>
    <p>If you knew that a certain type of exercise could benefit your heart, improve your balance, strengthen your
        bones, and help you lose weight all while making you look and feel better, wouldn't you want to get started?
        Well,
        studies show that strength training can provide all those benefits and more.
    </p>
    <p>Strength training — also known as weight or resistance training — is physical activity designed to improve
        muscular fitness
        by exercising a specific muscle or muscle group against external resistance, including free-weights, weight
        machines, or your own body
        weight, according to the definition from the American College of Sports Medicine. (1)

    <h2>How Strength Training Helps Your Health</h2>
    <!--<div class="line-left">-->
    <h3>1. Strength training makes you stronger and fitter.</h3>
    <p>Strength training is also called resistance training because it involves strengthening and toning your
        muscles
        by contracting them against a resisting force. There are two types of resistance training: (3)
    <ul class="training-list">
        <li><i class="fas fa-heartbeat"></i>Isometric resistance involves contracting your muscles against a nonmoving
            object, such as against the
            floor in a push-up.
        </li>
        <li><i class="fas fa-heartbeat"></i>Isotonic strength training involves contracting your muscles through a range
            of motion as in weight
            lifting.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Strength training protects bone health and muscle mass.</h3>
    <p>
        At around age 30 we start losing as much as 3 to 5 percent of lean muscle mass per year thanks to aging. (4)

        According to a study published in October 2017 in the Journal of Bone and Mineral Research, just 30 minutes twice a week of high
        intensity resistance and impact training was shown to improve functional performance, as well as bone density, structure, and strength
        in postmenopausal women with low bone mass — and it had no negative effects. (5)

    <h3>3. Strength training helps keep the weight off for good. </h3>
    <p>
        Aerobic exercise such as walking, running, and cycling is well known as a way to help increase the number of calories you burn
        in a day and shed extra pounds. But strength training helps, too (even if you’re not burning a huge number of calories during the workout).

        Exercise science researchers suspect strength training is helpful for weight loss because it helps increase your resting metabolism
        (meaning the rate at which your body burns calories when you’re just going about your day, not exercising).

        A study published in the journal Obesity in November 2017 found that, compared with dieters who didn’t exercise and those who
        did only aerobic exercise, dieters who did strength training exercises four times a week for 18 months lost the most fat
        (about 18 pounds, compared with 10 pounds for nonexercisers and 16 pounds for aerobic exercisers). (6)
    </p>

    <h3>4. Strength training helps you develop better body mechanics.</h3>
    <p>
        Strength training also benefits your balance, coordination, and posture. (7) One study showed that in older people who are at higher
        risk of falling (and causing a lot of damage) because of worse physical functioning, strength training reduced risk of falling by 40
        percent compared with individuals who did not do strength-training exercise. (8)

        “Balance is dependent on the strength of the muscles that keep you on your feet,” Pire notes. “The stronger those muscles, the better
        your balance.”
    </p>

    <h3>5. Strength training can help with chronic disease management.</h3>
    <p>
        Studies have documented the many wellness benefits of strength training, including helping people with some chronic diseases manage their
        conditions. If you have arthritis, strength training can be as effective as medication in decreasing arthritis pain. (9)

        And for the 14 million Americans with type 2 diabetes, strength training along with other healthy lifestyle changes can help improve
        glucose control. (10)

    <h3>6. Strength training boosts energy levels and improves your mood.</h3>
    <p>
        Strength training will elevate your level of  endorphins (natural opiates produced by the brain), which lift energy levels and improve mood.
        (11) As if that isn't enough to convince you, there’s evidence strength training may help you sleep better, too. (12)
    </p>

    <h3>7. Strength training translates to more calories burned.</h3>
    <p>
        Strength training helps boost your metabolism (the rate your resting body burns calories throughout the day). But weight or resistance training
        can help boost your calorie burn during and after your workout, too.

        You burn calories during strength training, and your body continues to burn calories after strength training (just like you do after aerobic exercise),
        a process called "excess post-exercise oxygen consumption" or EPOC, according to the American Council on Exercise. (13) When you do strength, weight, or
        resistance training, your body demands more energy based on how much energy you’re exerting (meaning the tougher you’re working, the more energy is demanded).
        That means more calories burned during the workout, and more calories burned after the workout, too, while your body is recovering to a resting state.
